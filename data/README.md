This is where all the data are stored. This includes input data from external sources or output data generated by scripts.

The primary purpose of Github is to store code and track code changes. Therefore, in general, it is bad practice to use Github to store large data, because doing so introduces clutter and significantly slows down upload/download when trying to update the repository. (An exception is small subsets of data used as examples for how a particular script runs.)

For this reason, I've decided to omit all the data from this repo. Instead, follow the instructions in each README.md to find links to the files you need. All the data are linked in various places from the [course website](https://diytranscriptomics.com/data), but in the specific README files, I will include both a link to the specific page on the course website that contains the link to the download and the link itself.

Note that I cannot guarantee that the links will always be available. They are being hosted on Dan Beiting's private Gmail account, and he may choose to change or remove them. I apologize in advance if that happens, and hope that the logic in the scripts is clear enough that you can adapt.
